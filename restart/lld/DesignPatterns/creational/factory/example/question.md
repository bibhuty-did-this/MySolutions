## Factory Design Pattern Question

**Question:**
Design a system for a pizza restaurant where customers can order different types of pizzas. The restaurant serves pizzas like Margherita, Pepperoni, and Veggie. Each pizza has its own set of ingredients and preparation methods, but all pizzas share common steps such as preparing the dough, baking, and packing. The system should allow for the easy creation of new types of pizzas without modifying existing code.

Use the **Factory Design Pattern** to implement this system, ensuring that new pizzas can be added with minimal changes and the client code remains decoupled from the creation process.
