# Singleton Design Pattern

The **Singleton Design Pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

## Key Characteristics:
- **Single Instance**: Only one instance of the class is created throughout the application.
- **Global Access**: The single instance is accessible globally, which means it can be used from different parts of the program.
- **Controlled Access**: The Singleton class itself controls the creation of the instance.

## Use Cases:
- **Configuration Settings**: Where a single configuration manager is needed across an application.
- **Logging**: For a centralized logging system to avoid the creation of multiple loggers.
- **Resource Management**: Like connection pools, where a single resource manager must manage shared resources.

## Advantages:

1. **Controlled Access**: Ensures that only one instance of the class is created, which controls resource usage.
2. **Global State**: Provides a way to share data or state globally across the application.
3. **Lazy Initialization**: The instance can be initialized only when it’s needed, reducing memory consumption.

## Disadvantages:

1. **Global State**: Can introduce issues related to global state, which can make testing difficult.
2. **Thread-Safety**: Implementing the Singleton in a multithreaded environment requires additional handling (like double-checked locking).
3. **Tight Coupling**: Singleton can increase the coupling between classes since it provides global access to its instance.

## When to Use Singleton:

- When exactly one instance of a class is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
- When the instance is to be shared globally but you want to control access to it.

## When Not to Use Singleton:

- When the application needs to maintain multiple instances of the class.
- When you need a design that is easy to test and doesn’t involve global state, as Singleton can make testing harder.
